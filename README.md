# ClassiNet: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

ClassiNet is an advanced image classification project utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to categorize images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 color images, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels and organized into 10 distinct categories.

## Objective

The primary goal of ClassiNet is to develop an effective CNN model capable of accurately classifying images into their respective categories. This project serves as a foundational exercise in computer vision, applicable in areas such as object recognition and autonomous driving systems.

## Technologies and Dataset
This project utilizes **Python** as the primary programming language for model development and used **TensorFlow** and **Keras** frameworks to design and train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Data visualization and model performance assessment are conducted using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, while **Scikit-learn** is employed for comprehensive model evaluation metrics. The dataset utilized is CIFAR-10 that comprised 60,000 images distributed across 10 distinct classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship and Truck. This dataset is partitioned into training and testing subsets to enable effective model training and performance evaluation.
