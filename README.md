# ClassiNet: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

ClassiNet is an advanced image classification project utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to categorize images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images, each 32x32 pixels in size, spread across 10 distinct categories.

## Objective

The primary goal of ClassiNet is to develop an effective CNN model capable of accurately classifying images into their respective categories. This project serves as a foundational exercise in computer vision, applicable in areas such as object recognition and autonomous driving systems.

## Technologies and Dataset

This project employs **Python** as the core programming language for model development, utilizing **TensorFlow and Keras** for constructing and training the CNN model. **Matplotlib and Seaborn** are used for visualizing data and model performance, while **Scikit-learn** aids in evaluating the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance. The code is executed and shared using **Kaggle Notebook**. The CIFAR-10 dataset, used in this project, consists of images categorized into 10 classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck. It is divided into training and testing sets to support model training and evaluation.
